# Kubernetes Logical vs Physical Separation in AKS

## **Physical vs Logical Separation**
- **Physical Separation**: Using multiple clusters to separate workloads.
  - Pros: Strong isolation between workloads.
  - Cons: High resource overhead, wasted capacity, and increased administration.

- **Logical Separation**: Using **namespaces** within a single cluster for workload isolation.
  - Pros: 
    - More cost-efficient.
    - Supports higher pod density.
    - Reduces idle compute capacity.
    - Simplifies administration with shared resources.

## **Namespaces in Kubernetes**
Namespaces provide **logical isolation** within a cluster, enabling multi-tenant or multi-workload setups. Microsoft recommends logical isolation for:
- Isolating teams, projects, and workloads.
- Managing resources more efficiently with auto-scaling.

## **Default Namespaces in AKS**
1. **kube-system**:  
   - Manages cluster resources (e.g., CoreDNS, metric server, connectivity agent).
   
2. **kube-node-lease**:  
   - Nodes communicate their availability to the control plane.

3. **kube-public**:  
   - Shared resources visible across the entire cluster by any user.

4. **default**:  
   - Allows resource usage without creating a new namespace.
   - Suitable for development but not ideal for production.

## **Best Practices**
- Use **logical isolation** (namespaces) for production environments.
- Create separate namespaces for workloads to improve organization and efficiency.
- Avoid multiple physical clusters unless strict isolation is required.
